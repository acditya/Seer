# Assets Directory

This directory should contain:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen (1242x2436px)

You can use placeholder images or create your own.

For quick placeholders, you can:
1. Use https://placeholder.com or similar services
2. Or create simple colored squares with your preferred design tool

The app will work without these files in development, but may show warnings.
